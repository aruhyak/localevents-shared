/**
 * Conversations about a help request.
 *
 * The flow this supports:
 *   1. someone posts "can anyone watch the dog next week"
 *   2. a neighbour offers to help — that offer opens a conversation
 *   3. the two of them go back and forth in it
 *   4. the poster picks ONE person
 *   5. only that person can see the poster's phone number
 *
 * ── SHAPE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A thread is identified by (postId, helperId), not by an id of its own. That
 * is not a shortcut — it encodes the rule. There is exactly one conversation
 * between a poster and each person who offers, and it is impossible to create
 * a second by accident, because the key is the pair itself.
 *
 * The poster is never part of the key. They are a participant in every thread
 * on their own post, which falls out of the post's author rather than needing
 * to be stored.
 *
 * Exactly one person is eventually chosen. That is what separates a request
 * from an event: an event wants a crowd, a request wants one person with your
 * house key, and "first to reply wins" is the wrong shape for that.
 *
 * ── A LIMIT WORTH BEING HONEST ABOUT ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Phase 1 runs entirely in the browser. Messages are stored on the device that
 * wrote them, so a reply does not reach the other person, and `canSeeContact`
 * is a UI rule rather than enforcement — anyone opening devtools can read the
 * lot. Both live here rather than inside a component so that phase 2 can move
 * them behind the BFF unchanged: the API stops returning what is not yours,
 * and every caller keeps working.
