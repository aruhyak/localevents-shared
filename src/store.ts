/**
 * Posts created on this device.
 *
 * Phase 1 has no backend, so a post you write has to live somewhere or it
 * disappears the moment the sheet closes — which is what was happening: the
 * shell logged the new post to the console and dropped it. Nothing you wrote
 * ever appeared in the feed, and an uploaded photo had nowhere to go.
 *
 * localStorage rather than memory so a post survives a reload. That matters
 * during the trial: a friend posts something, closes the tab, comes back, and
 * expects it to still be there.
 *
 * Phase 3 replaces this wholesale with the BFF — `addLocalPost` becomes a POST
 * and `localPosts` becomes a GET. The photo stops being a data URL and becomes
 * an S3 key. Callers do not change.
