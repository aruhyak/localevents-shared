/**
 * What is waiting for you.
 *
 * Derived, never stored. A notice is a fact about the data — "someone replied
 * to your post", "they chose you" — so it is computed from posts and replies
 * rather than written into a separate table that can drift out of step with
 * them. Delete a post and its notices vanish with it, which is the correct
 * behaviour and needs no cleanup code.
 *
 * The only stored state is a single timestamp: when you last looked. Anything
 * newer than that is unread. That is a far smaller thing to keep correct than
 * a read/unread flag per item, and it cannot get stuck.
 *
 * Phase 2 replaces the derivation with a query and the timestamp with a column
 * on the user row. The shape callers see does not change.
